# Problem Specification

This template is the output of the SPECIFY phase. Every field is required. Leaving a field empty indicates the analysis was incomplete — revisit before proceeding.

## Why This Template Exists

A specification forces precise thinking before code is written. Ambiguity in requirements is the most common source of rework. By filling out every field, the agent demonstrates understanding and the user can confirm or correct before any code changes occur.

## Template

Copy and complete the following for every task:

```markdown
# Problem Specification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Request | [Exact user request — quoted verbatim] |
| Functional Requirement | [What the code must accomplish — stated precisely] |
| Technical Constraints | [Platform limits, sandbox rules, framework requirements] |
| Identified Edge Cases | [List each edge case with handling strategy] |
| Affected Files | [See table below] |
| Risk Level | [LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH with justification] |
| Dependencies | [External packages, services, config changes needed] |

## Affected Files

| File Path | Action | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| path/to/file | Create / Modify | Why this file needs to change |
| path/to/file | Create / Modify | Why this file needs to change |

## Edge Cases

| # | Edge Case | Handling Strategy |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | [Describe the edge condition] | [How the code will handle it] |
| 2 | [Describe the edge condition] | [How the code will handle it] |

## Notes

[Any additional context, assumptions, or clarifications]

## Field Guidance

| Field | Guidance |
|-------|----------|
| **Request** | Quote the user's exact words. Do not paraphrase. This anchors the specification to the original intent. |
| **Functional Requirement** | Translate the request into a precise technical statement. Use "must" language: "The system must render a list of items sorted by creation date." |
| **Technical Constraints** | Reference `knowledge/architecture.md` for sandbox constraints. Include framework requirements (e.g., "Must use server components for data fetching"). |
| **Identified Edge Cases** | Think about empty inputs, missing data, concurrent operations, boundary values, and error states. Each edge case needs a concrete handling strategy, not just identification. |
| **Affected Files** | Every file that will be created or modified must be listed. The action column uses "Create" for new files and "Modify" for existing files. |
| **Risk Level** | LOW = single file, well-understood pattern. MEDIUM = multiple files or minor uncertainty. HIGH = schema changes, architectural impact, or significant uncertainty. Justify the rating. |
| **Dependencies** | Include packages to install, services that must be running, and configuration changes. If none, write "None." |

## Complexity Tier Abbreviation

For simple tasks (single file, no schema change, no new dependencies), SPECIFY and PLAN may be combined into one output. The problem specification fields above are still required — they appear in the combined document alongside the implementation plan fields from `procedure/templates/implementation-plan.md`.
