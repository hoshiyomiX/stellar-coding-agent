## Activation

```
☄️ STELLAR · v5.1.0 · ACTIVE
   Phase State Machine · Traceability IDs · Artifact Templates · SSV
```

This framework structures coding work as a phase machine. It provides templates and traceability tools — abbreviate when the task is simple, but never skip entirely. The phases exist because skipping straight to code is how most bugs happen, not because every task needs a formal spec.

## When Active

A **task** is any request that produces code, file changes, or deliverables. Conversation, questions, and feedback are not tasks.

When a task begins: state which phase you're entering. When a task ends: output a PCR block (see Process Compliance Report below). For simple tasks (single file, no schema change), combine SPECIFY+PLAN into one paragraph — but still output PCR at the end.

## Preview Bootstrap

A custom splash page is included in `assets/page.tsx` (closeable + minimizable). To activate the preview panel each session, the dev server on port 3000 must be running. Run once:

```bash
bash boot.sh
```

This checks the remote repo for updates and pulls if available (fast-forward only, skips if local changes exist), self-heals skill files (copies git-tracked `skill/` → `skills/`), deploys the custom page to `src/app/page.tsx`, and starts the dev server via `.zscripts/dev.sh`. The platform detects port 3000 and shows the preview panel automatically. Idempotent — exits immediately if already running.

## Limitations

This framework is text in a skill file. It cannot guarantee compliance, force behavior, or persist across sessions. The LLM reading this may follow it closely, loosely, or not at all depending on context, attention, and task complexity. The QA Attestation is self-graded — useful as a confidence signal, not independent verification. The user is the final judge of quality.

## Phase State Machine

```
IDLE → SPECIFY → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → DELIVER
  ↑                                        │
  └──── Error Recovery ◄───────────────────┘
```

On error: stop, diagnose, fix, return to VERIFY.

| Phase | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| IDLE | Receive task, classify complexity |
| SPECIFY | Restate problem, identify constraints and edge cases, list affected files |
| PLAN | Create implementation steps with Traceability IDs |
| IMPLEMENT | Write code, reference Traceability IDs |
| VERIFY | Run checks, trace edge cases, confirm Traceability IDs satisfied |
| DELIVER | Present results with attestation |

Phase definitions, entry/exit criteria, and transition rules are in `procedure/phases.md`.

## Phase References

| Phase | Artifact Template | Knowledge Files |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| SPECIFY | `procedure/templates/problem-spec.md` | `knowledge/architecture.md` |
| PLAN | `procedure/templates/implementation-plan.md` | `knowledge/conventions.md` |
| IMPLEMENT | (code output) | `constraints/code-standards.md`, `constraints/type-safety.md` |
| VERIFY | `procedure/templates/verification-report.md` | `knowledge/error-patterns.md` |
| Error Recovery | `procedure/templates/incident-report.md` | `procedure/decision-trees/error-resolution.md` |

## Source State Verification (SSV)

Before analyzing or auditing a git repository, verify data freshness:

1. `git fetch` to sync remote references
2. Compare local HEAD against `origin/<branch>`
3. If behind, `git pull` or `git checkout <branch>` after fetch
4. If referencing a specific commit, verify it exists in history
5. Only proceed after SSV passes

SSV is required after cross-session boundaries or when previous sessions involved git operations. Skip SSV for purely creative tasks with no git involvement.

## Error Recovery

1. **Stop** — do not continue past errors
2. Document the error (incident report template)
3. Ask the user before any action with side effects (git changes, file deletions, destructive operations)
4. Fix root cause, not symptom
5. Return to VERIFY and re-verify

Git rules (overrides defaults):
- `git fetch` and inspect before `git pull` — if remote diverged, stop and ask
- No `git rebase`, `git reset`, `git push --force`, or `git merge` without explicit user instruction
- If git is blocked by infrastructure, stop all git operations and inform the user

Full decision tree: `procedure/decision-trees/error-resolution.md`.

## Process Compliance Report

Output this block after every task (see "When Active" above). Phases not applicable to the task are marked N/A.

```
☄️ PCR
├─ SPECIFY     : PASS / N/A
├─ PLAN        : PASS / N/A
├─ IMPLEMENT   : PASS / N/A
├─ VERIFY      : PASS / N/A
└─ OUTCOME     : PASS / FAIL

Evidence: [concrete results — e.g. "lint 0 errors, 4/4 traceability verified"]
Defects found and fixed: [n]
```

Self-graded. The evidence requirement and defect counter make fabrication harder but cannot guarantee independence. A claim of 0 defects means first-attempt correctness. If OUTCOME is FAIL, do not deliver — return to the appropriate phase.
